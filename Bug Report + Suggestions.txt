## Bug Reports

1) !joinedat reports last time someone joined the server, rather than when they originally joined
2) When some is striked they can still talk in VC
3) Bot auto deltes messages from bots with links
<<<<<<< HEAD

4) moderation commands arent working right now

## Ideas

1) Give the ability to give someone a strike without muting them, for small offenses but still ones that should be written down
2) Automatically apply the '?' role to anyone who has an account less than a week old, could help with alt identification
3) Impliment an automatic bug report system
