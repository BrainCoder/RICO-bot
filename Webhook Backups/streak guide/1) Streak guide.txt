This channel explains and highlights how to start and maintain your streak.\n\nTwo channels can be used to maintain your streak. If you want to have an associated role with your public streak, type commands in <#760427949421363230>. If you want to keep your streak anonymous, type commands in <#760244981838512158>. This system is subject to change in the future as we transition to using the new bot.\n\n__**Starting up your streak**__\n\nTo start your streak, type !relapse into the appropriate channel. This will start a timer that tracks your NoPMO streak. This command can also be used to reset your streak if you relapse.\n\nIf you already have a NoPMO streak, you can add the following arguments to the end of the !relapse command.\n\n!relapse <DAY COUNT>\n!relapse <DAY COUNT> <HOUR COUNT>\n\nExamples:\n!relapse starts your streak the moment you post the command.\n!relapse 2 starts your streak from 2 days ago.\n!relapse 0 13 starts your streak from 13 hours ago.\n\nTo update your streak, type !update in your preferred streak channel.\n",
