      "description": "__**Bot Commands**__\n\nThese are the bot commands that work in every channel\n\n**!m** - Posts a motivational picture, video or link.\n**!lynch @user** - If porn is posted and there's no mod around to ban them, then you can mute them yourself with `!lynch @user`. 3 members using this command are necessary to mute that person. Using the command legitimately will temporarily take away your member role until a mod gives it back while abusing the command will lead to losing the member role or getting banned\n**!selfmute <time>** - This will give you the self mute role, which is the same as the mute role without any strikes. To mute yourself for 1 day 3 hours you would do `!selfmute 1d 3h`\n\nComplaints\n\nSend a direct message to <@!749836263955103774> with your complaints if you have any.\n\nSpecial Roles\n\nVIP\nTo get the <@&749033237438791691> role, you have to do one of the following:\n1. be very active and helpful to people struggling with PMO\n2. boosting the server will give you VIP perms, however, these will be removed when your boost expires.",
